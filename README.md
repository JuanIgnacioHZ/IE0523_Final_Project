## IE0523_Final_Project

Final project for digital circuits II class at the School of Electrical Engineering, UCR

The task was to implement and validate the transmitter part of IEEE 802.3 Gigabit Ethernet section 36, that is the transmitting side of ethernet physical coding sublayer.

The code was developed along with other student:

    - Jimena González Jimenez, B83443
    - Juan Hernández Zamora, B93826

In order to replicate the obtained results, run `make` on the repository directory. It has the following dependencies:
    - Icarus Verilog version 12.0 (stable) (v12_0-dirty)
    - GTKWave Analyzer v3.3.120

The Documentacion directory has some miscellaneous documentation files and images used in the development process.
